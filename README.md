# hdf5-_tools
provides some wrapper functions for the [h5py library](https://www.h5py.org)

`h5view.py` allows the listing of the groups, attributes, and datasets in a `.hdf5` file without having to open the GUI. Also allows for the printing of datasets as numpy arrays

# future plans:
integration with:
